# 🤖 Rafif's Projects

This repository contains a documentation of my embedded systems projects about creating a prototype robot for helping out people to expele a phlegm from their throat. It includes Program Documentation and also Physical Design of robot's body.

## 🔧 Design

---

## 🚀 Features & Highlights

- ✅ Modular DC motor controller with encoder feedback (Arduino-based)
- ✅ PID-based X-Drive motor speed control
- ✅ IMU sensor filtering with Madgwick filter (MPU6050, BMI160, BMX160, MPU9250)
- ✅ ROS2 node for :
  -> Communicating with other microcontroller using UART protocol
  -> Position control with dead reckoning navigation and PID
  -> Receiving data from non-ROS2 program (python program outside the ROS2 ecosystem)
  -> Early development of custom fusion algorithm using EKF to fuse wheel encoder, freewheel encoder and IMU
